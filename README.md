## Coding Assessment

### Instructions:
You have been asked to take a list of contact information and identify which contacts are
potentially duplicates. You need to write a function that will do the following:
1. Identify which contacts are possible matches.
2. A score for each match that represents how accurate you believe the match is. This
   scoring is defined by you.
3. A contact might have multiple or no matches
4. All processing should be done in working memory (no database).
   
Example:
#### Input

| Contact ID | First Name | Last Name | Email Address                  | Zip Code | Address              |
|------------|------------|-----------|--------------------------------|----------|----------------------|
| 1001       | C          | F         | mollis.lectus.pede@outlook.net |          | 449-6990 Tellus. Rd. |         |
| 1002       | C          | French    | mollis.lectus.pede@outlook.net | 39746    | 449-6990 Tellus. Rd. |                      |         |
| 1003       | Ciara      | F         | non.lacinia.at@zoho.ca         | 39746    |                      |         |

#### Output

| ContactID Source | ContactID Match | Accuracy |
|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 1001             | 1002            | High     |  
| 1001             | 1003            | Low      |

The input file is included in the assessment packet.
As part of your solution you will need to produce:
1. The code used to identify the potential duplicates
2. A set of tests that you use to verify the functions
3. Comments in the code are welcome

## Coding Assessment Solution
>Evaluate potential duplicates with a similarity score. `0 - 1000`

---

### Start
Build and execute
```bash
go mod download
make build-app
./score.app -f input.xlsx -o out.xlsx
```

### Test
```bash
make test
```
### CI
You need `golangci-lint` installed
```bash
make all
```

### Docker utility container
You do not need to have Go installed, just Docker and a linux environment
```bash
bash run -i input.xlsx -o out.xlsx
```
